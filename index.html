<hr><h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>A question that seems to plague me every so often. My name is Mike Tougeron. 
I’m also know as Michael, Touge, Teivan, mtougeron, and “hey you!” It all depends on if you know me personally, at work,
online, or online a few years ago. I currently work at Adobe as a Lead Site Reliability Engineer working with Kubernetes.
I live in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area in Concord which is the far East Bay. I have a wife (Denise), a boy named
Justin, a house, two dogs and two cats. I’ve always lived in northern CA, mostly in Sonoma County until 2004, except for
that  random summer where I lived in Indiana. BTW, I’m never going back. I have a variety of interests including tech,
programming, reading books, watching movies, fine red wines, board games, and a few other things that I can’t think of
at the moment.</p>
<p>Remember, reality is all in your head...</p>

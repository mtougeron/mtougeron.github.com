{"name":"Mike Tougeron","tagline":"","body":"Yo, this is my github profile. I really need to add some stuff here but meanwhile this is what ya get.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Who am I? \r\n\r\nA question that seems to plague me every so often. My name is Mike Tougeron. I’m also know as Michael, Touge, Teivan, mtougeron, and “hey you!” It all depends on if you know me personally, at work, online, or online a few years ago. I currently work at IGN Entertainment as a Senior Software Developer on the API team. Currently my focus is on the community and user features of IGN.com. I live in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area in Concord which is the far East Bay. I have a wife (Denise), a boy named Justin, a house, and two cats. I’ve always lived in northern CA, mostly in Sonoma County until 2004, except for that random summer where I lived in Indiana. BTW, I’m never going back. I have a variety of interests including high tech, web developing with php & javascript, reading books, watching movies, fine red wines, board games, and a few other things that I can’t think of at the moment.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
